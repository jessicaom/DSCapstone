<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this data science project is to come up with a recomendation model for media and entertainment for a streaming services. This streaming service provider suspects it may not be optimally engaging its useres, relative to other services. It also does not have a strong sense of what current shows and movies matter most to its users, particularly which ones they're most likely to pay more for. This project aims to build a predictive model for media recomendation based on a number movie ratings, genres, release date e.t.c. This model will be used to provide guidance on movie an tv recommendations apprach.

### Datasets

#### Netflix prize data

The first dataset contains over 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous Netflix customers over 17 thousand movie titles.
The data were collected between October, 1998 and December, 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 (integral) stars. To protect customer privacy, each customer id has been replaced with a randomly-assigned id. The date of each rating and the title and year of release for each movie id are also provided.

#### Netflix shows data

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.
